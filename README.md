Pluto's Revenge (A Game for Ludum Dare 38 - A Small World)

Play as pluto and exact your revenge on the other planets for kicking you out. Use your gravitational pull to hurl passing asteroids and comets into other planets.

NOTE: Unfortunately we never finished this one due to game jam burnout. There's some basic gameplay though: the gravity mechanic works (but doesn't quite feel great), and Pluto makes some pretty rad faces as you fly around, I also think we got Mercury in.
